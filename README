Welcome to the Python Snippets archive!
---------------------------------------

This archive collects together a large collection of Python Snippets that are useful for learning different aspects of Python
and application development. These snippets were primarily collected together for use inside Acire; a little program for
browsing, running and playing with snippets. You can find out more about Acire at http://www.launchpad.net/acire.


> Preparing Your Snippet <

To add a snippet to the archive you should first ensure the snippet works and demonstrates the example well.

You should now add the following meta data as comments to the top of the file:

    # [SNIPPET_NAME: A Short Name For The Snippet]
    # [SNIPPET_CATEGORIES: Category]  <-- see CATEGORIES file for existing categories
    # [SNIPPET_DESCRIPTION: A single line description of the snippet]
    # [SNIPPET_AUTHOR: Your Name <your@emailaddress.com>]
    # [SNIPPET_LICENSE: An Open Source license (from the LICENSES file)]
    # [SNIPPET_DOCS: http://www.linktoonlinedocs.com, http://www.anotherlink.com]]
    
Here is an example:
 
    # [SNIPPET_NAME: Playing a Pipeline]
    # [SNIPPET_CATEGORIES: GStreamer]
    # [SNIPPET_DESCRIPTION: Construct and play a pipeline]
    # [SNIPPET_AUTHOR: Jono Bacon <jono@ubuntu.com>]
    # [SNIPPET_LICENSE: GPL]
    # [SNIPPET_DOCS:http://pygstdocs.berlios.de/pygst-tutorial/pipeline.html]
    
When adding licenses, please use one of the licenses listed in the LICENSES file.
